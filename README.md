# Sargassum_H2S_emission
R code and data on H2S concentration during pelagic Sargassum decay on beaches in Mexico

Since 2011, over 30 tropical Atlantic nations have experienced substantial landings of holopelagic Sargassum spp. Its decomposition results in the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which, in elevated concentrations, can pose a threat to human health. 
This study seeks to understand the temporal and spatial variations in H2S emissions resulting from Sargassum decomposition and to assess potential health risks for communities, tourists, and cleanup workers. 

Data: H2S-All

H2S measurements (in ppm) monitored using a SENKO sensor (SGTP-H2S; limit of detection 0.1-100; precision 0.1 ppm) at four distances from Sargassum accumulation points of (0, 10, 30, and 40 m) in Puerto Morelos, Mexico, during 2022 and 2023. 

Data: H2S-Tran

H2S measurements taken in nine 15-m-long transects in a random configuration, running parallel to the shoreline within the central region of decomposing Sargassum piles. This data collection was carried out from 11 August to 14 September 2023. 
For each meter along the transect, the following data were recorded: 1) H2S concentration levels beneath Sargassum piles, measured using a SENKO SGTP-H2S sensor with a precision of 0.1 ppm and a limit of detection (LOD) from 0.1 to 100 ppm; 
2) The width and height of Sargassum piles, measured in centimeters with a precision of 5 cm; 3) the temperature of the sand beneath the algae, assessed with a calibrated thermometer, accurate to 0.1 Â°C; and
4) wind speed at the height of 1 meter above ground level, measured using a portable anemometer AIOMEST AI-100-WM. 

Data: PCA_data_tran

Data base used to conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to investigate the relationship between H2S concentration and the following variables: a) air temperature, b) the temperature beneath Sargassum piles, c) Sargassum pile width, 
d) Sargassum pile height, e) wind speed, and f) wind direction.
